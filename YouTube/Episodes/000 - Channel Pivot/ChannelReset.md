# I'm doing a channel reset and pivoting my content

## Notes
- Channel was "reset" to pivot content
- Time has passed to allow for the "Algorithm" to "forget" about my channel
- No idea about how the Algorithm works, might be similar to page ranks
- Okay if people unsubscribe

## Script

### Introduction
Hi! This video is aimed at my subscribers, that might have subscribed for a multitude of reasons, to give you guys a heads-up that my existing content is now locked away, and a I'm taking the channel in a different direction.

### The new path
My passion and profession is being a .net developer, to the point that I might tab out of a video game to write code instead. I want to make videos sharing my passion, thoughts, experience through tutorials and showcasing other peoples' work through code-reviews.

### Why
The reason for this and the complete "removal" of old content is that I had no content to add and I was tired of negative comments on old videos. Also, I want to do something to expand my skillset to include teaching as a career-building strategy

### What
I will start out with some videos that most likely will be inconsistent while I attempt to get a good "workflow" and setup for my videos

The channel will try to have some regular "series" like code reviews of open-source repos, just to have a look at how things are different and to be opinionated.

I would also like to experiment in graphical things, like using graphics from scratch like OpenGL

I have a lot of ideas, some good, some horrible, but I'd like to bring people along for the ride, so I might do some streaming of programming

### When
I will try to start as soon as possible, but I'll be taking it a bit "casual" and not promise anything about when I will start or how often something will happen as it's something that I need to get in the habit of doing

### Thanks
I will understand anyone unsubscribing or whatever because, I'm not seeing me doing gaming content for a while, unless it's in context of programming, but thank you for having subscribed to me in the first place

I hope this will be as I intend and not just a "false start", as so many projects tend to be. Wish me luck.

### Godbye
Since this is released in december I'd like to wish everyone a merry christmas and a happy new year!
