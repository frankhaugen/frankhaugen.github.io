### introduction
Greetings! In this video I'll be doing a very high-level showcase of LinqPad and why and how I use it

This is not a tutorial, just a simple demonstration of what I use it for

### What is LinqPad?
LinqPad is a super powerful tool or a simple IDE for dotnet developers

It's possible to do all your dotnet programming in it but that's not what it's intended for. It's intended to be a secondary tool next to a proper IDE like Visual Studio

It has a free version, but I strongly recomend that you pay for it, because of the added features and to support the developer

### Who and what is it for?
Any dotnet developer in either F#, VB.net or C#.

### How I use it
Linqpad's core functionality is to query databases using dotnet, and that's how I use it, (my SQL skills are horrible), let me demonstrate how great it is to use it to query a table: `See example`

I also use it for quick prototyping and enum -generation. Maybe I want to create a small script to move and rename some files, or I want to extract data from the CultureInfo -class to generate an enum, something that I easy enough to do in a console app, but it's much simpler and quicker to do it in LinqPad. `See example`

### Price
There's multiple price-levels. I have the 115$ with all the bells and whistles, but there's also a free version with a very limited feature-set `Show website`

I Recommend that you try it out and then when you have decided to buy, you should by the most expensive one. If you are a professional developer, you can afford it. If you aren't a professional yet, I reccomend that you use the free version or buy at what level you can afford; there is upgrade pricing, so you can go tier-by-tier
