# WPF without XAML

## Background
I'm making this because I want to show how to work with my favorite UI tooling for dotnet software without using the horror that is XML -like syntax


## Steps

1. Find a new folder and create a worker project and a solution for it adding the project
2. 

## Commands
Add project : `dotnet new worker -n WpfRocks`
Add solution : `dotnet new sln -n WpfRocks`
Add project to solution: `dotnet sln add WpfRocks/WpfRocks.csproj`
